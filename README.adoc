== Overview

The slides corresponding to the different talks given in the frame of the lotus-initiative.

Each talk corresponds to a subfolder.

To create a new one, simply start from an older one and everything should build easily, thanks to @bjonnh!

But, as a reminder, here is just the final command:

[source,asciidoctor]
----
bash build.sh
